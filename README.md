# Hardware Development — SystemVerilog Assertions & Formal Verification

## Overview
This repository contains a **portfolio of lab projects** focused on **SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)** and **Formal Verification** techniques.  

SystemVerilog (IEEE 1800-2017 standard) is a unified hardware design, specification, and verification language widely adopted by chip designers and verification teams to improve productivity and ensure **first-pass silicon success**. While rooted in Verilog, SystemVerilog introduces powerful enhancements, including:
- Improved scheduling semantics
- Rich data types
- Interface constructs
- Assertion-based verification
- Formal verification methodologies

## What’s Inside
The portfolio covers both **theory** and **hands-on practice**:

### **Part 1: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)**
- Understanding immediate vs. concurrent assertions  
- Practical use cases and real-world design protocols  
- Syntax and semantics of SVA  
- Writing assertions for verification of hardware designs  
- Coding guidelines with realistic examples

### **Part 2: Formal Verification**
- Fundamentals of formal verification theory  
- Running formal tools for property checking  
- Debugging counter-examples and refining assertions  
- Methodology choices for integrating assertions into a formal flow  

---

## Learning Approach
This is a **lab-based learning experience** where you will:
- Work through targeted exercises on SVA and formal concepts  
- Use assertions in both **simulation (VCS)** and **formal verification (VC Formal)** environments  
- Gain practical skills for debugging, refining, and validating hardware designs  

By the end, you will have explored **assertion-based verification** from basic syntax to advanced formal methods, equipping you with skills applicable to industrial-scale chip design and verification projects.
