AEP Lab Assignment – VC Formal

Student Information

Student Username: sv111610
Platform Used: VLSI01 (Linux-based environment)
Tool: Synopsys VC Formal (Version W-2024.09-SP2)

Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of Advanced Electrical Properties (AEP) checks using Synopsys VC Formal. The RTL design includes modules that intentionally exhibit design issues like:

Parallel and full case mismatches
X-propagation
Multiple drivers
Out-of-bounds memory access
Floating signals

These are checked and analyzed using VC Formal in AEP mode.

File Paths (as per submission requirements)

TCL Script: ~/Desktop/HW6/aep_lab/test.tcl

Output Results: ~/Desktop/HW6/aep_lab/results_aep.txt

To run the project,

Opened the terminal and went to the project directly 

cd ~/Desktop/HW6/aep_lab

To run the VC formal tool with the TCL script:
vcf -f test.tcl

test.tcl Summary

The TCL script performs the following:

Sets the VC Formal mode to AEP

Reads the RTL file list from filelist

Sets aep_top as the top module

Specifies clock (clk) and reset (resetn) signals

Simulates for 10ns and sets up initial state

Launches AEP checks and writes results to results_aep.txt
